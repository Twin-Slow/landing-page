                <p>Tired of weak little fireballs and flimsy swords? Wanna <em>punch</em> someone with a tree? Hug a bear <strong>while becoming one</strong>? Good news, barkbrain: you're a <strong>druid</strong>, and Nature's got your back (and probably a wolf gnawing on your leg for good measure).</p>

                <strong>Introducing: THE WILD</strong>
                <p>Not just a place you get lost in anymore - it's now your personal spellbook, gym, therapist, and angry wilderness gym coach all rolled into one!</p>

                <p>You ever looked at a wizard's spellbook and thought, "That needs more leaves and maybe some sap?" Well guess what, log-lover: <strong>you <em>are</em> the spellbook now.</strong> Your spells smell like pine, your cantrips are biodegradable, and your biggest weakness is lumberjacks. Congratulations.</p>

                <p>Cats, dogs, owls, a disgruntled goose named Steve? <strong>You command them all.</strong> You're basically a Disney princess if they swapped musical numbers for tactical battlefield dominance and turned the woodland choir into a tactical wolf strike team. <strong>Go ahead. Weaponize the squirrel.</strong> We dare you.</p>

                <p>Clerics get holy light. Wizards get arcane brilliance. You? <strong>You get vitamin D and a strong breeze.</strong> That's right- while the rest of the party's chugging healing potions like soda at a LAN party, <strong>you're healing from standing near a fern.</strong> You are the one who sunbathes. You are the one who grows.</p>

            <p>Rogues sneak, fighters punch, sorcerers yell at reality until it changes. But druids? <strong>Druids love.</strong> Love the earth, love the sky, love that one very specific moss-covered boulder that you named "Greg" and took on three adventures because you <em>felt a vibe.</em> No judgment. Nature provides. <strong>Greg understands.</strong></p>

                <p>If so, think about taking a breath of fresh air, and reconnecting with nature on a peaceful trail. Every step makes a difference. Bring a bag and help keep the path beautiful by picking up litter as you go!</p>
